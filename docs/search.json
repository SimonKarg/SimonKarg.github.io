    "text": "Hi, my name is Simon. I’m an assistant professor at Aarhus University. I’m also a dad and rock climbing enthusiast. Here are some more things about me:\n\nI’m fascinated by morality. What do we consider to be good or bad? What makes a person virtuous? And what do actions reveal about a person’s moral character? For example, I’ve written a paper on how fans of Logan Paul reacted in light of the “suicide forest scandal”.\nI love R. I’m always eager to learn new things about R, new packages, ways to be creative, analyzing data. Above all, I love visualizing data.\nMy current main projects revolve around hate and counterspeech on the internet. Together with fantastic colleagues, I’m working on the STANDBY project, trying to understand what makes people stand up against online hate, and what effects upstanding has to decrease hate long term.\nI have also worked on corruption and dishonesty, in particular the phenomenon of collaborative corruption, when people collaborate in order to achieve dishonest goals. For instance, I’ve found that cheating collaboratively increases mutual trust.\nI am a strong proponent of open science. All my studies and projects have open data, open materials and open code. You can find most of my materials on OSF.\nYou can find a few examples of my work and projects showcased on this website."
